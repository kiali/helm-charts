Welcome to Kiali! For more details on Kiali, see: https://kiali.io

The Kiali Server [{{ .Chart.AppVersion }}] has been installed in namespace [{{ .Release.Namespace }}]. It will be ready soon.

{{- if not .Values.deployment.cluster_wide_access }}
===============
!!! WARNING !!!
===============
This Kiali Server Helm Chart does NOT support "deployment.cluster_wide_access" set to "false"!

This feature, as well as others, is only available when using the Kiali Operator to install
the Kiali Server. It is for this reason this Kiali Server Helm Chart, while provided for
convenience, is not the recommended installation mechanism for installing the Kiali Server.
{{- end }}

When installing with "deployment.cluster_wide_access=false" using this Kiali Server Helm Chart,
it is your responsibility to manually create the proper Roles and RoleBindings for the Kiali Server
to have the correct permissions to access the service mesh namespaces.
